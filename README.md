# Countries Info App

This is a small application built using [React](https://react.dev/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), and [Vite](https://vite.dev/), where you can get basic information about countries around the world.

[Demo](https://countries-two-chi.vercel.app/)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
